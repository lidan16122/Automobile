            <b className="car-news-article-desc pb-5">Bentley unveils a new sporty version of the large coupe Bentley Continental GT, But this time it is not an end version based on the famous W12 engine, not necessarily on the basis of the more modest V8 engine in this way Bentley enables an accessible sporty version, relatively of course, and this is a necessary step since the V8 versions have become particularly sought after since the launch of the model in 2019.</b>

                        <h2>What have they done?</h2>
                        <p>In order to strengthen the sporty impression, the Bentley Continental GT S receives a sporty exterior theme expressed in shiny black decorations that replace the traditional chrome decorations, and blacked-out S emblems on the front wings. The taillights feature dark cladding, A thin blackened spoiler was installed on the trunk door. As an option you can choose light rims with a diameter of 22 inches in a satin black shade, or 21 inch rims in two-tone painting. In both cases red calipers will peek through them.</p>
                        <p>The passenger cabin also gets a unique sporty finish with the option of combining two shades.</p>

            <p>Along with the fine leather a suede-like material was incorporated into the steering wheel cover,the gear selector, the seats, and the headrests, and it gives a contrasting texture to the smooth leather. The headrests have an embroidered S logo, which you will also find on the dashboard facing the front passenger, and on the illuminated door sills.</p>
            <p>The engine used by the entry-level versions of the model remains unchanged, and it's hard to say we were disappointed, Because it is a V8 twin turbo engine with a volume of 4.0 liters with a maximum power of 550 hp and a maximum torque of 78.5 kgm, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The new S series includes a new and sporty exhaust system that provides a deeper sound. Acceleration from standstill to 100 km/h has not changed and takes 4.0 seconds in the coupe body and 4.1 seconds in the cabriolet body.</p>
            <p>The Bentley Continental GT S is equipped with the Bentley Dynamic Ride system based on active electric control with a power of 48V capable of producing a force equivalent to 132.5 kgm in the active stabilizer bars in order to minimize body bending in turns and improve driving comfort by disconnecting the opposite wheels in favor of individual handling of potholes.</p>
