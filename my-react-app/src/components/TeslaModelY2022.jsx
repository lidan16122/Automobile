            <b className="car-news-article-desc pb-5">Say hello to the Tesla Model Y, which is essentially a bigger, more spacious Model 3 and should appeal to buyers looking for extra SUV practicality over the compromises that come with a hatchback-sized family car and it is fully electric with a good battery life. The new Tesla Model Y is essentially a raised SUV version of the Model 3. It comes with the same blend of a great range, quirky software and Tesla’s brilliant global charging network.</b>

                        <h2>Is the Tesla Model Y a good car?</h2>
                        <p>The Tesla Model Y is an electric SUV that is a cutting-edge alternative to models such as the BMW iX3, Audi Q4 e-tron and the forthcoming Mercedes EQB.</p>
                        <p>Based on the hugely popular Model 3, it’s a bit like if someone uploaded a picture of a Model 3 into Photoshop and started stretching its proportions. It’s longer and ever so slightly wider, but noticeably (more than 15cm) taller, meaning it looks more like a shrunken Model X.</p>
                        <p>The extra size means, unsurprisingly, extra space. The Model Y was first shown as a seven-seat model directly rivalling the EQB, but it’s only sold as a five-seater for the time being – Tesla won’t say when three-row models will go on sale.</p>

            <p>Still, those in the rear get more head and legroom than in a Model 3, and all the seats are raised up to give a better view out. It also offers a huge 1,869-litre load bay with the rear seats down, which is more than you get even in the roomy Skoda Enyaq. You get a panoramic glass sunroof as standard to make the interior feel light and airy, too.</p>
            <p>Like every other Tesla including the Model 3, the Model Y has a giant infotainment screen dominating the dashboard, and very little in the way of physical switchgear. The screen is in a landscape style (rather than portrait), is 15-inches in size and used to control almost all the car’s systems – even the door mirrors. It takes a bit of getting used to, but is one of the best screens on the market in terms of graphics and response.</p>
            <p>Instead of using a key, you access the Tesla using your phone and you can send electronic keys to friends and family for car sharing. That’s done using the Tesla app, which also allows you to heat and cool the car before you get in it, track the car’s location and even limit its top speed.</p>
            <p>Summon Mode is by far the cleverest feature, though. It means the Model Y will be able to drive out of its parking space and meet you, autonomously.</p>
            <p>That said, most of the time you’ll want to do the driving – if only to experience the Tesla’s ludicrous acceleration. The top-end Performance version can get from 0-60mph in just 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 150mph.</p>
            <p>While cheaper models could arrive later, initially the Model Y is available in the UK in two versions: Long Range and Performance.</p>
            <p>As the name suggests, the Long Range can go furthest on a charge with a claimed range of 315 miles. Its 0-69mph time is 4.8 seconds, which is hardly slow. But, of course, the Performance model has supercar-baiting pace. That sacrifices range, however, which is down to 298 miles.</p>
            <p>The Model Y does a decent job of mimicking the Model 3 when it comes to handling, too. There’s little body lean and quick steering to make it feel more agile than it should given its size, although it isn’t quite as entertaining as the saloon. The ride is also firm – more so if you spec the optional 20in wheels, where it borders on harsh at times.</p>
            <p>Of course, the Model Y will have access to Tesla’s comprehensive and reliable Supercharger charging network. The latest 250kW Superchargers will add 75 miles of range to the Model Y in just five minutes, while 15 minutes of charging will add 158 miles.</p>
            <p className="pb-5">UK pricing for the Tesla Model Y has been confirmed ahead of the first cars arriving in early 2022. The Long Range model will kick off from £54,990, while the Performance version starts at £64,990.</p>
            <h2>How much is the Tesla Model Y?</h2>
            <p>The Tesla Model Y has a RRP range of £57,990 to £67,990. However, on carwow prices for a new Tesla Model Y start at £54,990 if paying cash or £602 if paying monthly - saving on average £0. The price of a used Tesla Model Y on carwow starts at £61,500.</p>
            <p className="pb-5"><b>In Israel the Tesla Model Y  has a price range of 234,990₪ - 466,541₪</b></p>
            <h2>How practical is it?</h2>
            <p className="pb-5">The Tesla Model Y offers enough room for five adults to sit pretty comfortably and has a huge boot. It’s a shame there’s no seven seat option yet, however.</p>
            <h2>What's it like to drive?</h2>
            <p>The Tesla Model Y has the same strong performance as the Model 3, and handles pretty well.</p>
            <p>You can choose between two versions of the Tesla Model Y, initially at least, because unlike with the Model 3 on which it’s based there will be no entry level Standard Range Plus variant at launch.</p>
            <p>The cheapest model is therefore the Long Range version. Even that puts out a healthy 440hp, though, with electric motors powering both the front and rear wheels for a 0-60mph time of 4.8 seconds and a 133mph top speed.</p>
            <p>The Long Range is the only version we’ve driven, and frankly it offers all the performance most people are ever likely to need – and some. Being electric and four-wheel drive it fires off the line with real urgency in Standard mode, although you can switch to Chill mode to slacken off the throttle response and reduce the power for a more relaxed driving experience.</p>
            <p>The Performance model only adds around 50hp or so on paper, but is capable of a blistering 0-60mph time of  3.5 seconds. That’s as fast as a four-wheel drive BMW M3, which shows you how bonkers quick it is in every situation.</p>
            <p className="pb-5">The trade-off with the Model Y over the cheaper Model 3, though, is that its heavier and taller body impacts both performance and efficiency. Tesla estimates it’ll do around half a mile per kWh less than a Model 3, which is why the Long Range model promises a range of 315 miles compared with 360 miles on the equivalent Model 3. That figure is about the same as the longest-range VW ID 4, but not as far as the most efficient versions of the Ford Mustang Mach E.</p>
            <h2>What's it like inside?</h2>
            <p>The Model Y’s interior looks and feels like a Model 3, so it’s super minimalist, while material quality seems decent enough</p>
            <p className="pb-5">The interior design of the Model Y is pretty much identical to that of the recently updated Model 3. That means it either looks cool and minimalist or a little basic depending on your viewpoint.</p>
