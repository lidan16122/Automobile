# ReactJS Project
Hello, my project is about car information.
On this website you can browse the latest car news, explore new cars and see information about them and even compare cars together. This information can be useful to people who don't have knowledge about cars and are interested to buy one or just browse for fun.
- On the main tab, you can see some articles and some car cards with little information.
- On the latest car news tab, you can browse the latest and hottest car news. this tab is more to expand your knowledge about cars and what happens around the world about cars.
- On the car information tab, you can browse the website car cards, see the information about the cars, and even filter them in case some cars are irrelevant. this tab can help you find your suitable car if you want a fuel economy car or a sporty one, a more luxurious interior or a simpler one.
- On the car comparison tab, you can compare cars together to see what is the difference between them. this tab is like the car information tab but this tab is used to compare car information together and not to look up a specific car, can be useful if you debating about some cars.
